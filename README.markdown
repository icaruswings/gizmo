Gizmo
============

In homage to its humble beginnings as our 'gremlin' testing submodule.<br />
With which we were entrusted and asked to follow 3 simple rules...

* "Don't get it wet"
* "Keep it away from bright lights....especially sunlight"
* "Don't ever feed it after midnight"

We didn't listen, and it got nasty...<br />
So, we've gone back to the drawing board and come up with a friendlier, cuddlier testing helper.

**Gizmo** is a simple page model testing framework used and sponsored by [realestate.com.au](http://www.realestate.com.au). The aim of the project is to DRY up testing assertions by abstracting code that defines your page, resulting in a consistent, easy to maintain test suite. The code is maintained by Contributors from REA, and largely based on concepts brought to REA by [Mark Ryall](http://github.com/markryall) and other [thoughtworkers](http://thoughtworks.com.au/)
